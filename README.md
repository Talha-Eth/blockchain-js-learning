# 📘 Blockchain JavaScript Learning Journal

Tracking my journey of learning full-stack blockchain development.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Day 1 | Variables, arrays, basic math, template strings |
| Day 2 | Functions, if/else, for loops |
| Day 3 | Objects, arrays of objects, map/filter/reduce, token logic |

## 🔧 Tools I'm Using

- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub
- (Soon) Truffle, Solidity, Hardhat, Ganache


## ✅ Day 4 - Promises & Async/Await

- Learned how to use Promises, `.then()`, `.catch()`
- Practiced `async`/`await` with error handling
- Simulated blockchain-style contract interactions


| Concept         | Purpose                                                                    | Used With                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `try` / `catch` | To handle **any error** in your code (like a crash, or a rejected Promise) | `async/await`, functions, error-prone code |
| `.then()`       | What to do when a **Promise resolves successfully**                        | With `Promise`                             |
| `.catch()`      | What to do when a **Promise is rejected** or fails                         | With `Promise`                             |

## JS finished

## -----Solidty-----
## 🔐 Solidity Progress (Day 1)

- ✅ Set up Hardhat and created a real Solidity development environment
- ✅ Wrote and deployed a smart contract (`HelloWorld`) locally
- ✅ Used `ethers.js` to interact with the contract via Hardhat console
- ✅ Learned `msg.sender`, `require()`, and constructor usage
- ✅ Implemented access control: only the contract owner can update state
- ✅ Built secure functions with input validation and ownership checks
